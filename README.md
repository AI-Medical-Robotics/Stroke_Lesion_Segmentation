# Stroke Lesion Segmentation

## Outline

- Data Exploration 10GB ATLAS 2.0 Dataset
- Prepare ATLAS 2.0 Stroke Data 
- Stroke Segmentation Model Architecture
- Train Stroke Segmentation ML/DL Models
- Evaluate Stroke Segmentation ML/DL Models Quantitatively
- Evaluate Stroke Segmentation ML/DL Models Qualitatively
- Deploy Stroke Segmentation DL Model for Inference

Each stage of the DL Pipeline, we are able to do volume rendering to show what is happening in 3D.

Unity and/or Voreen for volume rendering the AI/ML results.
